          Pass 'em On is a notes renting platform which resolves a key issue
          that we as students of VIT face which is getting hold of good notes
          which help us prepare for our exams. Considering that one doesn't have
          time to prepare their own notes from scratch with other priorities
          like DA's and quizzes lined up. Let's be real, smart work is way
          better than hard work, everyone studies at the last minute, so if you
          have good verified notes, that basically solves your problem of
          finding out the key aspects of a particular module. Our platform
          essentially bridges this gap between the people who are in need of
          notes and those who do not require them anymore and do not mind
          providing it to the next person. The best part is that there is no
          money involved, so you can gain access to verified high quality notes
          for free without any hassle !! SO JUST RENT, READ, REPEAT.
